Portainer Install Using Task Scheduler &amp; Docker

Step 1
Install Container Manager via the "Package Center" on Synology. If your DSM version is less than 7.2, look for Docker rather than Container Manager.

Step 2
Locate and open the docker folder in File Station. Make a new folder called portainer inside the docker folder. Observe the guidelines provided in the picture below.
Remember to only use lowercase lettersâ€”never uppercase.
